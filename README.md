# FinSecure

FinSecure is a proposed payment system that aims to provide a secure and reliable method for conducting financial transactions. The system is designed to ensure the privacy and security of users' financial information and transactions, with a focus on holding money in escrow until certain conditions are met using smart contracts.

FinSecure will use a cloud-based database to store the bank details of each account and bind it to a certain value. The system will then use smart contracts to regulate the transaction process and hold the money in escrow until the conditions of the contract are met.

An intermediary service will be created between transactions to hold the money in escrow until the conditions of the smart contract are met, while a notification service will inform the sender and receiver about the transaction status. A user-friendly interface will also be developed for the payment system using a web or mobile application that will interact with the cloud services.

Overall, FinSecure aims to offer a secure and reliable payment system that ensures the privacy and security of users' financial information and transactions.
